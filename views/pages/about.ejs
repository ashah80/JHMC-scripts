                          I’ve loved math ever since I was little and I’ve been doing competition math since 4th grade, 
                          but lately I’ve gotten into pure math. Recently, I’ve participated in orals at ICTM. Outside of math, 
                          I’m interested in computer science, robotics, and physics.

              <h5>What needs must be addressed?</h5>
              <p>
                Ever since the first IMSA JHMC was held decades ago, our mission
                and core values have remained unchanged. We continue to believe
                that
                <strong
                  >middle school is an oft-neglected but critical formative
                  period for STEM-oriented students</strong
                >, during which a student's positive or negative experiences
                have an outsize impact on their future educational attainment.
                This is backed up by results from peer-reviewed studies: for
                example,
                <a
                  href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220670309596624"
                >
                  Wang and Goldschmidt 2003
                </a>
                finds that differences in mathematical opportunities during
                middle school translates to increasing educational inequity into
                high school.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that creating more opportunities for students to have
                positive experiences with mathematics will not only increase
                equity for disadvantaged students but also translate into better
                academic and career outcomes across the board for all
                participants.
                <strong>This is a deeply personal issue for many of us</strong>:
                almost all of the contest organizers are where we are today in
                no small part due to opportunities like MATHCOUNTS and the AMC
                8, which gave us an outlet to have fun with STEM.
              </p>
              <h5>How do we improve on existing programs?</h5>
              <p>
                We believe that an effective mathematics outreach program has
                two key traits: first, it <strong>makes math fun</strong>, and
                second, it gives students
                <strong>the opportunity to discover</strong> deep insights on
                their own. We believe that this second trait can't be achieved
                by simply "skimming the surface" of mathematics: while the gems
                of discovery might not be buried deep, students need to seek
                them out in extended problem-solving experiences, experiences
                which contests like the AMC 8 don't provide.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hence, we seek to expand on more conventional contest-math
                rounds in JHMC by diving deeper with our unique Creative
                Thinking round, where students solve short sets of themed
                problems extending beyond the normal middle school curriculum.
                This lets students discover deeper insights than what other
                middle school contests provide. We believe that this
                opportunity, provided during the critical time of middle school,
                among the relatively few nationwide math contests targeting this
                demographic, will significantly benefit both the math community
                and our country at large.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the foregoing reasons, we have decided on the following for
                the JHMC mission statement:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                "The IMSA Junior High Mathematics Competition aims to foster
                genuine interest in STEM by providing high-quality, intriguing

                of students at the middle school level."
